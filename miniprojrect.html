                        The first computer virus was created in 1983 by a programmer named Fred Cohen. He wrote the virus as an experiment to demonstrate the potential vulnerabilities in computer systems. The virus, named "Brain," was relatively harmless and only infected the boot sector of floppy disks. However, it marked the beginning of a new era in cybersecurity, highlighting the need for robust measures to protect against malicious software. Since then, cybersecurity has become a critical field in the tech industry, constantly evolving to combat increasingly sophisticated threats.
